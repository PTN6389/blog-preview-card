## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had the incorrect relative paths to css, images, and fonts, which worked in the 'Open with Live Server'. Once I deployed to the GitHub pages, it did not work in the browsers. So I need to double check my relative paths even if it works in localhost.

### Continued development

With this project I feel more comfortable with CSS Flexbox, but would like to continue practicing.
